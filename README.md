# üïäÔ∏è In Loving Memory of **Justin Edward Mitchell**

**November 16th, 1974 ‚Äì September 17th, 2025**

---

It is with broken hearts that we announce the passing of Justin Edward Mitchell, who left us far too soon on September 17th, 2025 at the young age of 50.

Justin was so many things to so many people. He was a beloved husband, father, son, nephew, cousin, friend, and colleague. He was a bright light in every room. He was the kind of person who could lift spirits with a single joke, a warm smile, or an off-the-cuff one-liner that somehow made everything feel okay. His sense of humor was unmatched, his laughter was contagious, and his joy for life was felt by everyone who knew him.

Justin was deeply devoted to his family, cherishing every moment spent together. From family gatherings to quiet nights in, family always came first in everything he did. He made sure everyone around him felt loved, supported, and seen.

Professionally, Justin was a gifted software developer. He was sharp, creative, and endlessly curious. He approached his work with the same passion that defined him. He was always eager to learn, solve the next problem, build the next thing, or help someone learn something new. He loved what he did, and it showed in the way he talked about it and how generously he shared his knowledge. Throughout Justin‚Äôs career as a software developer, he also helped his son, Alex, walk in his footsteps to becoming a software developer.

Outside of work, Justin found joy in video games ‚Äî not just as a hobby, but as a way to connect with his sons, Alex and Nathen. Justin also enjoyed watching The Walking Dead with his boys on a daily basis. Justin enjoyed listening to music, cooking, and dancing in the kitchen. Music was also a way that Justin connected with his boys. Justin was a wonderful father and best friend to his sons.

Though his time with us was far too short, the impact he had will be felt forever. He taught us to laugh louder, love harder, and never take life too seriously. We will miss his quick wit, his deep belly laughs, his warmth, and the way he made even ordinary days feel extraordinary.

He leaves behind a heartbroken but grateful family, including his wife, Erika, his children Alex and Nathen, his mother, Marie, and his mother-in-law, Sharon. Justin is preceded in death by his and Erika‚Äôs son, Anthony (passed January 17th, 2005), as well as Erika‚Äôs sister and Sharon‚Äôs daughter, Holly (passed April 14th, 2023). Justin also leaves behind countless friends and coworkers who were lucky enough to know him.

A memorial service will be held on October 25th, 2025 at Good Samaritan Lutheran Church at 11am. All who knew and loved Justin are welcome to attend and celebrate his life. The celebration of life will be followed by a reception at the church. Lunch will be served, and this time will be used to commiserate and share stories and kind words and thoughts about Justin.

In honor of Justin, we ask that you hold your loved ones a little closer today. And if you can, laugh a little louder, because he would have loved that.
